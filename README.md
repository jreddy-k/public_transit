**Download and Install Python 3.11:

Visit the official Python website: Python 3.11.0 Release.
Click on the “Downloads” tab and select the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows or macOS).
Follow the installation instructions provided on the download page1.

**Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to isolate your project’s dependencies.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment (replace “myenv” with your desired name):
python3.11 -m venv myenv

**Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

On macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate2.

**Install Dependencies:

If you’re using a virtual environment, make sure it’s activated.
Navigate to your project directory (where your Django project resides).
Install the required packages listed in your requirements.txt file using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run the Development Server:

With the virtual environment activated (if using one), run the following command to start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

By default, the server will listen on port 8000.

Access your Django application at http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.
